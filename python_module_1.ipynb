        "\n",
        "  1.  What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---> Python is a popular programming language that's used for many applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, and software development\n",
        " --->Easy to learn: Python is considered beginner-friendly.\n",
        "Efficient: Python can increase development speed.\n",
        "Versatile: Python is a general-purpose language that can run on many different platforms.\n",
        "Has a large community: Python has a large and active community of programmers who can provide support.\n",
        "Has many libraries: Python has many libraries and frameworks that can save time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-----> A Python interpreter is a computer program that translates Python code into machine code that a computer can understand and execute\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "---->   re-defined keywords in Python are words with specific meanings and uses that cannot be changed.\n",
        "Keywords in Python include: False, True, None, and, as, assert, async, await, def, del, elif, else, break, class, continue, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with and yield.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "\n",
        "---->  Keywords define the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to the human readers of the program to remember what the variable is used for.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "---->   In Python, mutability refers to the capability of an object to be changed or modified after its creation. In Python, lists are a widely used data structure that allows the storage and manipulation of a collection of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "---->  The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists. Tuples can't be changed after they're created, but lists can be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "---->   The main difference between the == and is operators in Python is that == compares the equality of objects, while is compares the identity of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.  What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " ---->  Logical operators in Python combine two or more operands and conduct logical comparisons on them. There are three types, i.e., AND, OR, and NOT. They return a boolean value, i.e., True or False\n",
        "\n",
        " 9.  What is type casting in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type into another. There are two types of type casting in Python:\n",
        "           1-> implicit typeCasting\n",
        "           2-> wxplicit typeCasting\n",
        "\n",
        " 10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "\n",
        " ----> The main difference between implicit and explicit type casting is that implicit type casting is automatic, while explicit type casting requires manual intervention\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-----> Conditional statements, also known as control flow statements, in Python allow programs to make decisions based on conditions. They determine the flow of code execution by evaluating a condition and executing a block of code if the condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work\n",
        "\n",
        "--->  The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "\n",
        "----->  Both for loop and while loop is used to execute the statements repeatedly while the program runs. The major difference between for loop and while loop is that for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas execution is done in a while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "14.   Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "----->  Use a while loop when you need to continue looping until a specific condition is met, rather than a set number of times. For loops are better for known iterations, like looping exactly 10 times. When checking for valid input or conditions, a while loop is the preferred choice\n",
