        "* Model real-world concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP lets developers model real-world entities as objects with attributes and methods. For example, a car can be considered an object with properties like its color, model, and price, and behaviors like acceleration and slowing down.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Definition: An object is a data structure that contains fields (data) and methods (procedures that define the object's behavior).\n",
        "2. Purpose: Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP applications, and are used to carry out computations.\n",
        "3. Creation: Objects are created using classes, which define their structure.\n",
        "4. Interaction: Objects can interact with each other through defined interfaces.\n",
        "5. Examples: Objects can represent real-world objects, like a person, car, or shopping cart, or more abstract entities, like a file or a measurement translator.\n",
        "6. Storage: Objects are typically stored in contiguous regions of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "------->> 4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, abstraction and encapsulation are both techniques that involve hiding data to improve code readability, security, and maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "* Simplifies complex systems by hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential functionalities. For example, the steering wheel and pedals of a car abstract the complex driving mechanisms.\n",

        "2. Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "* Secures data and functions within a class by restricting direct access to an object's data and methods. For example, the internal components of a car engine are encapsulated, hidden under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is enforced at the language level by using name mangling to make private members inaccessible. Private members are identified with a double underscore (__) and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",

        "* What they do\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods define specific behaviors for built-in operations or functionalities in Python classes. For example, you can use dunder methods to customize the behavior of common operations such as +, -, *, **, ==, %, @ and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "* How they are used\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods are typically not called directly, but are instead called implicitly by the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Some examples of dunder methods include init(), add(), sub, mul, divmod, abs, lt, gt, le, contains, getitem, and delitem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\". The double underscores are there to prevent name collision with other methods implemented by unsuspecting programmers\n",
        "\n",
        "------->> 6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows new classes to inherit attributes and methods from existing classes. This process creates a hierarchy of classes that share similar properties and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "---> Here are some key concepts of inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Parent class\n",

        "* The class that inherits from another class, also known as the derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing a child class to inherit all the functionalities of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---> Types of inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "There are five types of inheritance in Python: single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid.\n",
        "\n",
        "----> Here's an example of inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "* DataProcessor: The parent class\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "--------->> 7.  What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism is the ability to use the same function name for different types. This is achieved by differentiating each function based on its data type and number of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Polymorphism is an essential part of programming that allows developers to write clean, readable, and resilient codes. It can be used in various ways, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class polymorphism: A child class can have methods with the same name as a parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Method overriding: A derived class can redefine methods for its base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Operator overloading: A single type entity can represent multiple types in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in statically typed languages. Instead, Python allows developers to define a single method with a flexible number of arguments using default values, variable-length argument lists, or keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The word \"polymorphism\" comes from the Greek words poly, meaning \"many\", and morphe, meaning \"form\"\n",
        "\n",
        "-------->> 8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers to limit access to a class's variables and methods. Python uses a convention-based approach, rather than keywords like \"public\", \"private\", and \"protected\":\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Private members\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use a double underscore prefix (__) to indicate a private member. Private members are only accessible within the class and are intended for internal use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Protected members\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use a single underscore prefix (_) to indicate a protected member. Protected members are intended to be used within the class and its subclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "* By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public and can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation protects the internal data of a class and instances associated with it. It also allows for controlled access to the internal state of an object, which can help reduce the risk of accidental data modification.\n",

        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This is different from the default single inheritance in Python, which only allows a class to inherit from one parent class.\n",

        "1. __str__\n",
        "\n",
        "* Returns a human-readable, informal string representation of an object. This method is used for printing objects for users. It's called by the built-in print(), str(), and format() functions.\n",

        "\n",
        "* If a class doesn't define a __str__() method, Python will call the __repr__() method instead.\n",
        "* The __repr__() method should return a string that can be used to recreate the object.\n",

        "\n",
        "----> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method that's called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to perform actions like closing files, releasing locks, or closing network connections to clean up resources. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that resources are properly released, which can make applications more reliable and robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "--->> The __del__ method is called after an object's garbage collection occurs, which happens when all references to the item have been destroyed. This can happen when the reference count of an object reaches zero, or when the Python interpreter shuts down\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism and inheritance work together in Python when a child class inherits methods and attributes from a parent class, and then overrides some of those methods to fit the child class:\n",

        "3. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "* The child class method is allowed to have the same name as the parent class method. When the method is called on an object of the derived class, the version of the method defined in that class will be executed.\n",

        "2. Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "* Method chaining makes code more readable and concise, especially when working with objects that require multiple operations. It also avoids the need to store intermediate results in variables.\n",

        "1. Purpose: The call method allows programmers to invoke class instances as functions. This makes the instances callable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How it works: To make a class's instances callable, define the call method in the class. The call method works like any other instance method, taking self as\n",
