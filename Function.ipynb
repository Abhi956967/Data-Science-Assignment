        "\n",
        "---->  In Python, methods and functions have similar purposes but differ in important ways. Functions are independent blocks of code that can be called from anywhere, while methods are tied to objects or classes and need an object or class instance to be invoked. Functions promote code reusability, while methods offer behavior specific to objects. Functions are called by name, while methods are accessed using dot notation. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for writing organized, modular code in Python and harnessing the full power of methods and functions in various programming scenarios.\n",

        "-----> How Generators Are Defined\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generators are defined using the yield keyword instead of the return keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object. 1  Each time the next() function is called on this iterator, the generator function resumes execution from where it left off, until the next yield statement is encountered.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  Memory efficiency\n",
        "* Generators are more memory efficient than regular functions because they produce values one at a time, instead of creating an entire sequence in memory. This makes them ideal for working with large or infinite data sets.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  The map() function in Python applies a function to every item in an iterable, such as a list or tuple, and returns a result. The map() function is useful for a variety of tasks, including:\n",

        "The syntax for the map() function is map(function, iterable, â¦.). The function is the transformation function, and the iterable can be a list, tuple, dictionary, or set.

The map object can also be converted to sequence objects like a list or tuple using their factory functions.\n",
